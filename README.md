For storing files used for EDA for the NBC Universal Analytics Challenge at Temple University.
While my analysis was shallow (not to mention inefficient and arbitrary) at that point in time, this is the first time I carried out an analysis from start to finish. The notebook was not my team's submission, but it played a key role in developing our graphic, for which I was the primary contributor. 

Check out the notebook [here!](https://github.com/LinhHoang8997/NBC-Universal-Challenge/blob/master/NBCU%20Workbook.ipynb)
